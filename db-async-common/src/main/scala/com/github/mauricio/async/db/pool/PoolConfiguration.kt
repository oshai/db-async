 * @param maxObjects how many objects this pool will hold
 * @param maxIdle number of milliseconds for which the objects are going to be kept as idle (not in use by clients of the pool)
 * @param maxQueueSize when there are no more objects, the pool can queue up requests to serve later then there
 *                     are objects available, this is the maximum number of enqueued requests
 * @param validationInterval pools will use this value as the timer period to validate idle objects.
